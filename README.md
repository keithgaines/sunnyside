## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

In building this landing page, I gained a deeper understanding of using Flexbox, Bootstrap, and CSS Grid for web design. Flexbox allowed me to efficiently align and distribute elements in a flexible manner, while Bootstrap provided a solid foundation with its pre-designed components and grid system. CSS Grid allowed me to create complex and dynamic layouts, giving me the ability to manipulate rows and columns with ease. Overall, I learned the importance of combining these tools to create a responsive and visually appealing landing page.

### Continued development

Having completed this project, I am eager to continue developing my skills in web design. Next, I plan to explore advanced techniques in responsive design, experimenting with media queries and breakpoints to further enhance the user experience. I also want to delve into the world of animations and transitions, bringing a touch of dynamic flair to my projects. With a solid foundation in Flexbox, Bootstrap, and CSS Grid, I am confident in my ability to create engaging and visually stunning web designs. The possibilities are endless, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me.
